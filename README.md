<h1> Home Automation</h1>
<p> Hi, I have built a small Project on IoT , where I have connected my Android Application made with XML and Kotlin on the Android Studio with the ESP 32 microcontroller with the use of Relay and connected
AC current of my Home Appliances like the Water Motor, So that anyone can access the switch of the motor on their phone and they don't have to rush all the way down to just turn off the Motor if Water 
gets overflowed, hence this creates easiness and Saving of Water too.  This is been used by my family since last 3 months without any bigger damage. It feels so great to make something real, will 
make more good projects in future too.</p>
